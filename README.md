# LeafGPT ðŸ’¬

LeafGPT is an open source ChatGPT clone, created with React (frontend) and NodeJS (backend).
It works the same as ChatGPT, but it's open source and you can host it yourself.

Note that

-   this project is still in development (doesn't have a build yet)
-   this is not a fork of ChatGPT, it's a complete rewrite from scratch
-   this is powered by GPT-3.5 model by OpenAI
-   you can contribute to this project by opening a pull request or an issue

## Front-End

The frontend is built with React (Typescript) using:

-   [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
-   [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
-   [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
-   [React-Transition-Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)
-   [Socket.io-Client](https://socket.io/docs/v3/client-api/index.html)

## React App Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
